Disclaimer: All huts are good huts in that they save the weary hiker from a night out in their tent. However, some definitely offer more hospitable respites than others. When writing this article, I noticed that my favourable, or not so favourable, impression of a hut was largely due to the memories I associated with each one. Laughing with friends in an old, wriggly-tin hut might have been more magical than a quiet night in a new but sterile hut. All that is to say that this list is highly subjective and I welcome feedback and lively debate if you disagree with me!

**Best Huts of the Te Araroa Trail (South Island)**

**5. [Careys Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/southland/places/mavora-lakes-conservation-park/things-to-do/careys-hut/)**

![Carey's Hut with North Mavora Lake behind it](/img/img_20200119_190453_burst002.jpg "Carey's Hut with North Mavora Lake behind it")

A 6 bed hut in the Mavora Lakes region of the TA, it makes this list thanks to 2 factors: it's location and how happy I felt on approaching the hut. Carey's hut is situated right on the shore of North Mavora Lake, making it the perfect spot for a bit of much-needed post-hike swimming. I reached this hut on day 13 of my hike and I felt terrible! I was totally over hiking and didn't enjoy the walk there at all. Initially I had planned to push to the next hut (Boundary Hut) but I didn't have the extra KMs in me so decided to stop at Careys. And I'm really pleased I did! An afternoon spent frolicking in the lake and chatting with my hut-mates gave me some excellent memories and confirmed that stopping early was the right choice - it was a nice reminder to listen to my body and rest when required!

The hut is nothing fancy - you enter via a little boot room before getting into the hut proper. It's pretty small and simple but does the job for tired hikers! One slight caveat is that there is a 4x4 road that leads directly to this hut. When we arrived some people had driven up and were having beers and swimming - they were perfectly pleasant and respectful but if you want a more "backcountry" experience this hut may not provide.

WC: A bit of a walk from the hut but otherwise fine.

Wildlife: Definitely heard some mice scrabbling around in the night but they didn't get into our food.

**4. [Roses Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/wanaka-area/things-to-do/roses-hut/)**

I liked this hut for both objective and subjective reasons. Objectively, it is relatively new, clean, well-looked after and is on the Motatapu Track - in my opinion, one of the best parts of TA. Subjectively, it was the first hut I slept in on my own after 20-something days hiking with other people and I fell in love with the feelings of freedom and independence that gave me.

The hut has 12 beds - made up of double decker 6-person sleeping platforms - and a nice communal seating/cooking area. The water butt sits right outside on a pleasant wrap around veranda (perfect for drying your shoes in the sun) and there is a stream very close by too. I arrived fairly late (1800hrs-ish) after a long and eventful day of hiking, so was very pleased to arrive, unpack my things and cook dinner. There were about 6 other hikers staying and we chatted about the merits of leaving religious literature in huts and general hiker topics. I had one of the best nights sleep on the trail in this hut.

WC: Classic DOC hut toilet situation. No complaints.

Wildlife: Sandflies on the deck. Sheep in nearby fields. No mice.

**3. [Stone Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/te-kahui-kaupeka-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/stone-hut/)**

Stone hut isn't much to look at - in fact in falls under the Department of Conservation's "basic" category which means it's free to stay there but in return you shouldn't be expecting luxury. In spite of that I spent one of my favourite nights on the trail in this hut, hence why it has a special place in my heart.

It is in the section of the trail between Tekapo and the Rangitata River - on the Two Thumbs Track, in rolling and rugged countryside. When my tramily and I approached the hut it was towards the end of a long hiking day which had included the highest point on the TA (Stag Saddle) and be were pretty beat. The hut appeared like a mirage, tucked next to a stream, and looking very welcoming. Inside it is pretty basic, just 8 bunks arranged around 3 of the walls, a fireplace on the other and a small set of table and chairs in the middle of the room. My friends and I were the only ones there so we made ourselves at home, cooking dinner and taking a dip in the nearby stream to cool off. We were later joined by 2 SOBOs and chatted pleasantly. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I loved this hut so much, it just gave me exactly what I needed in that moment: a place to sleep, a table to joke with my friends around and somewhere to cook my noodles.

WC: As basic as you would expect with a "basic" hut.

Wildlife: I don't think rodents were strangers to Stone Hut, but we didn't see or hear any while we were there. No sandflies either!

**2. [Anne Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/st-james-conservation-area/things-to-do/huts/anne-hut/)**

This modern, 20-bed hut sits in a picturesque valley in between Boyle Village and Waiau Pass, slap bang in the middle of some of the gentlest trail-walking in the South Island. The hut has luxury features such as: indoor taps, a large veranda and, most excitingly, a game of Jenga. A large living area encourages socialising with fellow hikers and the wrap around windows afford amazing views up the valley and to the mountains on either side of the hut (including one called Philosopher's Knob...just saying). There are 2 bedrooms, each featuring the classic backcountry hut 5-person wide bunk beds and convenient hooks for your packs.

WC: Perfectly pleasant outdoor toilets with 2 to choose from - bonus!

Wildlife: No sign of sandflies but the veranda was off limits due to a surprisingly large number of curious bees.

**1. [Hope Kiwi Lodge](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/lake-sumner-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/hope-kiwi-lodge/)**

![Approaching Hope Kiwi Lodge - Photo courtesy of Happy Feet](/img/copy-of-dscf7868.jpg "Approaching Hope Kiwi Lodge")

For us NOBOs, Hope Kiwi Lodge is the last hut you can stay in before reaching Hamner Springs (and civilisation) after several long and tough days of hiking. Usually that would count against it as our simple hikers brains were often too consumed with thoughts of flat whites and pies in town the next day to appreciate our surroundings on the night before getting off the trail. This hut is pretty special though, and it definitely stood out despite our eagerness to get to the town famous for it's hot springs.

Despite it's grand name, the Hope Kiwi Lodge is still very much a hut. It's just a pretty posh one, with 20 bunks in 2 separate bedrooms (and 2 random beds in the living area), a wood burner, dedicated kitchen area and a couple of large communal tables. The hut sits in quite a desolate looking plain, giving it the look of a cosy respite from the bleak elements. This impression was enhanced as I approached and it started to rain, making me rush towards it's smoking chimney and dry interior.

My tramily and I reached the hut in the early afternoon so we had plenty of time to relax and appreciate the luxury of being warm and dry as it poured with rain outside. We knew we would resupply in town the next day, so had a veritable feast of leftover noodles, chocolate and anything else we didn't want to carry the next day. Shoes and socks were dried by the wood burner and all was well with the world. Apart from one thing - we were missing a member of our group! We nervously waited for several hours until we finally saw Quentin approaching the hut. Our relief at seeing him again (he had taken a wrong turn and ended up doing an extra 8km loop before getting back on the TA) and the gentle laughs at his expense led to an even more festive atmosphere in the hut that night.

WC: Pleasant toilet, although funnily enough it is on a elevated platform so you have commanding views from up there.

Wildlife: Nothing seen!

**Worst Huts of the Te Araroa Trail (South Island)**

5. **[Royal Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/te-kahui-kaupeka-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/royal-hut/)**

![Quentin and I weighing up whether or not to stay at Royal Hut - Photo courtesy of Happy Feet](/img/copy-of-dscf7262.jpg "Quentin and I weighing up whether or not to stay at Royal Hut")

So named for a flying visit from members of the British Royal Family, Royal Hut is yet another basic shelter on the Two Thumb Track between Tekapo and the Rangitata River. Objectively it is perfectly serviceable, with a layout almost identital to Stone Hut, and is situated in beautiful and rugged surroundings. However, when I approached with my tramily we were greeted by 3 decapitated Tahr heads (big goats) and their skins drying in the afternoon sun. A poke around the hut revealed a bunch of butchered meat hanging in the chimney too. Sharing a hut with some carcasses was a little bit off-putting for our gang so we decided to push on rather than stay the night. 

If I were to walk to TA again I would definitely consider staying in Royal Hut - but it makes my list of not so great huts this time around due to the uneasy feeling I got walking past those Tahr heads and finding the hut full of butchered meat. Maybe I've watched too many horror films but we thought it was best to bug out! 

WC: No complaints

Wildlife: Only the dead kind

**[4. Comyns Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/hakatere-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/comyns-hut/)**

![Trying to stay warm, and dry our socks, in Comyns Hut - Photo courtesy of Happy Feet](/img/copy-of-dscf7514.jpg "Trying to stay warm, and dry our socks, in Comyns Hut")

Comyns Hut is a basic hut in the Hakatere Conservation Park between the Rangitata and Rakaia rivers. It is constructed entirely out of corrugated iron (wriggly tin) and was built all the way back in 1957. It contains 8 bunks, a fireplace and set of table and chairs. It's construction style and material mean that the hut is very dark and very cold - it honestly seemed colder inside the hut than outside at points. I only wore my puffy jacket twice on the trail and once was while sitting in bed in this hut!

This hut ranks so low on my list as I was just so incredibly cold the whole time I was in there. We did manage to get a fire burning but because the hut sits on grassy plains, the only available wood came from a huge pile of matagouri outside. If you've ever tried to have a fire using matagouri you will know how fast it burns so the whole exercise in staying warm felt pretty futile. Morale was low in this hut and I spent the vast majority of my time here shivering in my sleeping bag.

WC: Provided a nice excuse to get out of the cold hut and had lovely views if you kept the door open.

Wildlife: Too cold for mice!

**3. [Crooked Spur Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/te-kahui-kaupeka-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/crooked-spur-hut/)**

![11 people's waterproof gear dripping on the floor of the Crooked Spur Hut - Photo courtesy of Happy Feet](/img/copy-of-dscf7330.jpg "11 people's waterproof gear dripping on the floor of the Crooked Spur Hut")

Crooked Spur Hut didn't stand a chance really, circumstances meant that it was always going to be an uncomfortable night in this shelter. Funnily enough, this hut was my tramily's next stop following our lovely evening in Stone Hut. Unfortunately, as we left Stone Hut the heavens opened and we experienced our first proper rain of the trail, by the time we reached Crooked Spur we were soaked through and excited to dry off. Imagine our disappointment then when we got inside to find that the hut had a leaking roof and we couldn't start a fire given that there was no wood (wet or dry) to be found!

Things got worse when 8 SOBOs arrived, equally wet and miserable. I think 11 people ended up sleeping in the 8 person hut and I had the misfortune of getting the bunk with a hole in the ceiling above it. My poor down quilt was rained on all night. 11 people's wet waterproofs were strung from the rafters, dripping into the packs of anyone not smart enough to keep them closed. It was claustrophobic and unpleasant all round.

WC: The toilet was a ways away from the hut and given the torrential rain, people were loath to go out to use it. It meant that 11 people had to wait for gaps in the rain in order to make a dash for the loo.

Wildlife: Far too wet!

**2. [Martin's Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/southland/places/longwood-forest-conservation-area/things-to-do/martins-hut/)**

As a NOBO hiker, Martin's Hut was my first encounter with New Zealand's backcountry hut system. While it is an interesting piece of history - being an old gold miner's hut built in 1905 - it is not exactly an inviting home for the night. The 4 bed hut is extremely basic, very dark, and when we stayed it was liberally scattered with rodent droppings. Unfortunately the hut is in the middle of the Longwood Forest so camping spots are few and far between - there is a small flat spot outside of the hut but this is often muddy and therefore not ideal for a tent either. 4 of us unpacked in the hut, but the 2 who got the top bunks quickly left, complaining that the smell of mouse wee was too bad up there! They opted to battle with the mud in their tent outside instead.

My hut mate and I spent a very unsettled night listening to mice/rats capering around. When I woke up there were fresh droppings on my mattress which was alarming to say the least. To add insult to injury the rodents had done some impressive acrobatics to get into my food bag, chewing a hole in it and eating all my porridge.

WC: The hut toilet is a ways off in the woods - a frankly horrible, cobwebby, experience. I took one look at it and went to dig a cathole elsewhere.

Wildlife: Hella rodents. Take care of your food bags!

**1.** [](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/te-kahui-kaupeka-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/royal-hut/)**[Camerons Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/lake-sumner-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/camerons-hut/)**

This hut makes the list for two reasons. The first one isn't really the fault of the hut, more an unfortunate coincidence, but basically as I approached the hut I bumped into a naked hiking guy. In theory there is nothing wrong with hiking naked I suppose, but bumping into this bloke in the middle of nowhere was a bit unsettling. Also - can you imagine the amount of sun cream required?! Second of all, this hut was absolutely the most delipidated one I came across. I would have rather spent the night in my tent than in this ramshackle, very haunted-looking, shelter. I popped my head in for a look and noticed holes in the ceiling, holes in the bed springs, no mattresses and a whole lot of rodent activity. 

WC: Not convinced there was one associated with this hut. I guess you'd use the woods. 

Wildlife: I suspect significantly more mice spend the night here than people

**Honourable Mentions**

**Birchwood Station**

![Sat outside Birchwood Station](/img/80473041_611205663016091_5453081192111682289_n.jpg "Sat outside Birchwood Station")

Not technically a hut but definitely deserves a shout out as one of the cosiest and unique places to stay on the TA. Probably provided my best night's sleep in Southland and, as a bonus, you can use their address to post resupply parcels to yourself. Birchwood Station is a working farm with a cabin that they rent out nightly to passing hikers. It has a shower, flushing toilet, wood burner, kettle, bunkroom and sweet kitchen/living area. Plus a veranda on which you can air your kit out and watch the farm dogs running around. The Station owners sometimes provide dinner and, if you volunteer to help out with farm jobs in the day, will let you stay a night for free. 

**[Hamilton Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/craigieburn-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/hamilton-hut/)**

![Hamilton Hut - Photo courtesy of Happy Feet](/img/copy-of-dscf7673.jpg "Hamilton Hut")

[](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/craigieburn-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/hamilton-hut/)I think the TA Guthook guide describes this as one of the best huts on the TA so I didn't feel the need to big it up any further in my write up but... it is worth the hype. A spacious hut with 20 bunks and a large communal area, Hamilton Hut allows for plenty of socialising. It is also right by the Hamilton Creek, which provides lovely views and a nice place for a dip. The only downside of this hut is that it has pretty high profile and therefore can be busy - with overnight hikers and TA hikers alike. When we stayed there were at least 22 people sleeping inside and several camping out the back too!

**Riverton Campsite**

I stayed here on my second night of the TA and it will have a special place in my heart for providing my aching limbs and feet with a huge comfy sofa to stretch out on in front of a log fire. The communal area of this campsite is super cute and comfortable and the owners are very accommodating for thru-hikers.
