You've been hiking for hours on rough and unforgiving terrain, your pack feels heavy no matter how many snacks you eat and it's pouring down with rain.  Finally, in the distance, you spot your home for the night - a back country hut.  Huts are wonderful and welcome refuges where hikers can shelter from the elements, meet other walkers, hear hiking beta, cook meals and most importantly sleep somewhere warm and dry* for the night.

New Zealand's South Island has an excellent network of back country huts designed for hikers and hunters to use as they enjoy the great outdoors.  The vast majority of these are maintained by the Dept of Conservation and hut passes can either be paid for on an ad hoc basis or you can buy a season pass that allows you to stay in as many huts as you like for a certain time period.  Of course most thru-hikers will opt for the 6 month pass which means each night ends up costing approximately $3.  Unlike huts in say, Switzerland, NZ huts are self-catered and usually pretty basic.  Most consist of just one room and therefore good hut etiquette is mandatory to ensure that everyone still likes you when you leave the hut in the morning. 

Sadly not everyone I met on trail had a sense of the usual hut conventions.  Take the following example for instance: It's 0500 hrs, an alarm goes off and a very bright white head torch goes on.  I'm in a 6-bed, 1 room hut and my alarm isn't due to go off for another hour.  The bright white light dances all over the room and my face as it's owner gets ready for the day, packing their kit, eating breakfast and getting dressed.  I resign myself to the fact that someone has planned an early start so shuffle down under my quilt and try to sleep.  Imagine my surprise when I got up to find the early riser still in the hut, leisurely still eating breakfast and drinking coffee.  He spent the best part of 2 hours getting ready in the morning, taking his sweet time and waking up everyone in order to do so.  Once he eventually left, well after his alarm and into daylight hours the remaining hut users exchanged the universal eyebrows raised "what a wanker" look. 

So, how do you avoid being considered a wanker?  Mainly use common sense and the same amount of courtesy that you would extend in urban life.  That said, here are some specifics that may come in handy if you intend to hike in New Zealand:

1.  **You have not booked a room in a hotel.**  Although there is a cost associated with staying in most huts in NZ, please don't assume that by paying for a hut pass or ticket that you have "booked a room".  Huts operate on a first come, first served policy so if it's a popular hut or a particularly small one then consider arriving earlier in the day to guarantee a bed.  You should always be prepared for the eventuality that you may not get a bed so pack a sleeping pad, which gives you the option of sleeping on the hut floor, and a shelter in case the hut is already full to the rafters.  Pro tip, some huts are so rat-infested that a tent will be a much pleasanter option anyway. 

2.  **Surrender to the lack of personal space.**  If you intend to stay in a hut, make your peace with the fact that you won't have much room to yourself.  Often the areas for cooking or socialising are cramped and can only accommodate a couple of people at a time.  You will find yourself squeezing past people and rubbing shoulders with others as you try to cook - if this sounds horribly claustrophobic then a tent may be for you.  Most huts come with outside space too but all too often these are colonised by sandflies and therefore highly unpleasant.  Be conscientious and gracious about sharing space and if you're lucky enough to have a bunk that's a good place to retreat to in order to keep out of other people's way. 

3.  **Lean into conversations.**  As someone who likes hiking alone the huts were my main opportunity to socialise.  Even when I felt tired and antisocial I soon found that talking to other hikers was valuable and interesting!  The Te Araroa attracts people from all over the world and it is remarkable to have the opportunity to meet walkers from different cultures but often people from home too!  There is something comforting about meeting another Brit on the other side of the world and finally having a sympathetic ear as I complained about the poor state of NZ teabags.  The main topics of conversation seemed to be: hiking beta from those going the opposite direction, gear, trail food and the town food we couldn't wait to eat.  My friends and I had to break the news to some hikers going SOBO that there wasn't another McDonalds for at least 1000km - they were very disheartened by this news no matter how many wonderful pie shops we told them about.  Remember that you're stuck in the hut with your fellow hikers for the night so it may be prudent to avoid the traditional dinner party conversational no-gos if you want a civil evening (no politics, no religion).

4.  **Read the room.**  On the other hand, although you might bound into a hut feeling starved of human interaction and wanting to hold forth over dinner, pay attention to the moods of those around you.  If people don't want to talk then don't try and force it.  There is nothing more annoying than that hiker who keeps making unsolicited comments on your gear, dinner or whatever in an effort to start a conversation.  My personal pet peeve is when people interrupt me reading to ask what I'm reading - especially when I then have to launch into a lengthy explanation of the lesbian necromancer plot points to do the book justice.

5.  **Consider light discipline.**  There is no such thing as privacy in backcountry huts, sleeping areas are communal and so if you turn your torch on in the middle of the night - everyone sees it.  Getting a head torch with a red light function is a game changer as it allows you to find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night without aggressively blinding everyone with a bright white light.  I would suggest using red light after bed time and early in the morning if you are getting up earlier than others. 

6.  **Noise discipline.**  This one is mostly common sense, don't be noisier than necessary and respect other people's bedtimes.  The people who arrived at a hut at 2100 hrs and decided to start playing with their drone were on the receiving end of some serious tut-tutting from me after ignoring this piece of courtesy. 

7.  **Conserve water.**  A lot of backcountry huts have water butts that are filled up by rain water.  Some will be near streams and the really fancy ones will have water pumped from the streams to the hut.  It is important to recognise which kind of hut you're in as this will have an impact on the availability of water for you and your fellow hikers.  The key takeaway is that in the huts with rain water tanks, water will be at a premium - especially during a dry spell.  On my trip some huts had empty tanks so it's worth asking hikers coming in the other direction about this as you pass.  Clearly where water is limited you should only be using it for drinking and cooking purposes - don't be tempted to wash your dusty feet (I saw someone doing this!) or rinsing mud off your shoes.  If you are staying at a hut near a stream of course you can use this stream to rinse your clothes or your body but don't be tempted to use any kind of soap as this will get into the water system and upset the ecological balance.  There really is no point in washing anyway as you will smell again tomorrow!

8.  **Set a good example and be kind.**  It's very easy to start feeling - and acting - holier than thou when spending time outdoors.  I'm definitely guilty of this (see my drone judgement for example) and it can lead to a toxification of outdoors culture whereby we end up policing other people's recreation and judging them rather than encouraging best practice.  I didn't just know all of the above tips, I was taught them by more seasoned outdoorspeople and by experience.  It is worth remembering that we all started somewhere and should cut each other some slack when it comes to hut etiquette.  That said I believe one of the best ways to encourage good practice in the outdoors is to set a positive example - it may just be that people are looking to you for inspiration on how to comport themselves in their home for the night.
