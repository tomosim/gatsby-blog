"Any fool can be uncomfortable" - An adage that has rung truer as I have got older and outgrown the performative suffering that I used to think was synonymous with merit. As bizarre and embarrassing as it sounds now, there was a time when I thought wearing gloves made you soft. Fortunately for me the consequence of this misguided opinion was limited to a few minor cold injuries. It could have been worse, I might have learned the value of warm extremities via the medium of frostbite or something. Over time, and with experience, I have grown to appreciate the extra accessories that make all the difference to a winter hillwalking trip. 

**\*\***This is not a definitive kit list for winter walking - it's key pieces of equipment that boost morale when it's cold out!**\*\***

**Gloves**

For me, nothing saps morale more quickly than having cold and wet hands. When temperatures drop your body jacks on your extremities by keeping warmth concentrated towards your core. If you're not careful this leads to cold ears, hands and feet. Cold hands are especially bothersome as they lose their dexterity and this can make performing simple tasks much harder. Some people advocate using pockets as handwarmers but then you are compromising balance and freedom of movement in order to stay warm. Personally, carrying gloves will always be worth the extra weight as they allow me to gesticulate expansively, point in the right direction and take great photos for insta without getting cold fingers. 

For non-technical outings, my preferred glove is Montane's Prism. The Primaloft insulation makes your fingers feel like they are in their very own little sleeping bags and the brushed microfleece lining still feels luxurious even after over a year of heavy use. The outer material is made from the durable water repellent (DWR) coated Pertex Quantum making the gloves both windproof and water resistant. They are great all-rounders - while their natural habitat might be on the hands of a hiker I have also taken them mountaineering in the Alps and winter climbing in Scotland. They haven't let me down yet, although full disclosure, I did get a small tear in one after a climb but I sewed it up and they feel good as new.  The gloves are around 60g - a weight penalty I can easily justify given how many times I have been grateful to put them on and how much happiness they have brought me. They cost £45 and have a lifetime guarantee. I consider them to be one of my sounder gear investments. 

**Buff**

The beauty of a buff is that it can be so many things to so many people. The way that mine gets used most often is as a neckwarmer. A draft of cold wind on your neck can really have a disproportionate effect on how chilly you feel so having a buff on standby is good practice. I probably don't need to tell you about all the other things you can use a buff for but, as an example, when I hiked the Te Araroa I used mine as: a neckwarmer, bandage, pillow case, silly hat, handkerchief, headband and as sun protection. Due to their versatility and lightweight nature I would always throw a buff into my pack. In cold weather you can cover your neck, ears, mouth and nose and easily adjust for temperature changes throughout the day.

I'm not actually sure if my buff is a branded Buff - I found it second-hand years ago and it's still going strong. I like that the pattern aligns with the hanky-code and the aesthetic in general. If I know I'm going somewhere super cold I'll bust out one of my more hardcore fleece neckwarmers but usually the once pictured above meets my needs. 

**Hat**

I'm not sure if it's exactly true that you lose most of your heat from your head but it certainly feels that way if you neglect to bring a warm hat out walking. Wearing a hat can make all the difference on a cold day and I find that I can regulate my temperature pretty well by taking it off and putting it back on again as I get hot and cold (this stops me having to break to add or remove clothing layers every 5 minutes). 

I picked up this particular hat in an effort to add some colour to my outdoor clothing colour palette. RAB is a local brand - based in Derbyshire - and I find that their gear performs to a high standard. It was £17 from Cotswolds Outdoors (retails for £20 but I got 15% discount).  No complaints so far, my head has been toasty even when my boiler broke and I had to resort to wearing it indoors.

**Brew**

There is nothing as restorative as a hot drink when you are half way through a long walk. If it's a lovely day, then it gives you an incentive to sit and enjoy the scenery, if it's howling then you at least have a cup of tea to stave off the cold. Sometimes I take my cook kit so I can make a cuppa en route but if I'm just out for a day walk then a classic thermos does the job perfectly. 

I carry a Lifeventure thermal mug which, at 300ml capacity and 262g weight, is unobtrusive enough for me to sling in a side pocket of my pack and forget about until a brew break beckons. Lifeventure says that warm drinks will stay warm for 6 hours - but in my experience you'll want to drink your tea sometime before the 4 hour mark (but I do like it scalding so maybe that's just me). These mugs retail for £11.99 and offer great value for the price. Bonus points for being easy to clean as opposed to thermal flasks with a more traditional "bottle" shape.

So those are my four can't-live-without-them winter walking accessories. There are plenty of other must haves when out hiking - warm kit, wet kit, navigation aids, illumination etc. Do your research and stay safe out there!
