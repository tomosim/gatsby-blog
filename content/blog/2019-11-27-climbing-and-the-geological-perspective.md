**Climbing is a magical thing** – in a few pitches you can travel through millennia. Each crimp represents layers upon layers of time that has been compressed, metamorphised or erupted into being.

It is also easy to forget all that in the moment, when you're praying that your foot won't pop off the wall or sweating through the crux of a climb.

I recently had a frustrating climbing experience where nothing seemed to be going right: the wall was seeping up until the first bolt. And I mean seeping. The rock was fully soaked and was covered in a layer of extra slippery moss. Once past this nerve-wrecking obstacle the climb improved and I spent a happy few metres plodding up the slab. Sadly, at the arête I was faced with the choice of going left, via a lot of tussocky grass and loose rock (but some awesome looking ledges), or sticking right on the face of the crag and inching my way up slowly using dubious footholds and pockets that were actually stealth slopers!

I went right and moved agonisingly slowly through a serious of committing moves, wishing the next bolt closer to no avail. I used every motivational tool I could think of to keep climbing: positive self talk, breathing techniques, imagining Company Sergeant Major Purcell shouting at me. After 7 bolts, they had all stopped working – even Coy Sgt Maj Purcell.

I had my very patient belayer take my weight and I sat back to reflect on the climb, tears of frustration threatening to spill. I was not enjoying myself at all and when I stripped away everything else, I realised I was only trying to keep going for fear of leaving a quickdraw on the wall. Looked at like that, carrying on seemed stupid.

I looked around, from my vantage point high above the valley floor I could see Lake Pukaki, it's milky azure waters still bright on a dull day. I saw hoardes of helicopters flying tourists to and from Mt Cook airport and was grateful for this much more intimate way of seeing the National Park. To my left were two huge and awesome examples of glacial action – flat bottomed U shaped valleys that ended abruptly in shear mountains on either side. My inner geography undergraduate student gave thanks for seeing an example that no textbook could ever recreate. Behind me was Aoraki, the cloud piercer, and some of the other seemingly indomitable mountains that make up the Southern Alps. This place was jaw-droppingly amazing, and here I was in a huff after fighting with one route, up one slab, at one crag.

I faced the wall and contemplated it's composition. A trip to the excellent Department of Conservation's visitor centre had informed me that this rock was schist that had been metamorphised at the breaking up of the super continent Gwondaland; uplifted 5 million years ago and then exposed indecently quickly by geological standards when the glaciers retreated 10 thousand years ago. Lichen looked back at me, a complicated and fascinating organism in it's own right. There was so much going on here on this piece of rock!

After my reflection I asked my belayer to lower me and let a more competent climber go up to collect the draws. On the long bush-bash back to the lodge I tried to appreciate the scenery around me. It had taken millions of years and unimaginable forces for this landscape to come into being and only an hour for me to lose patience with one climb. It was laughable really and put things in perspective. I endeavoured to appreciate the gift of a good crag more next time – and look forward to getting back on the schist in good time.
