What you wear says a lot about you: what you expect your day to bring, your profession, your hobbies or favoured brands.  And people make assumptions about you based on your clothing choices.  As a queer person, clothing can be imbued with a further level of meaning. As Kam Dhillon put it in their essay [Queering Fashion History](https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/queering-fashion-history): "clothing has historically been more than a sartorial medium for the queer community, itâ€™s adopted the form of a secret language to speak and connect with each other in periods of societal oppression."  Throughout history, and today across borders, homosexuality has been pathologised and legislated against.  Therefore the queer community has become adept at using appearance to signal many things, the hanky code being a prime example. 

Unsurprisingly the cisheteropatriachy is quite attached to their binary gender roles and so those of us who blur the lines of female/male in our identity, pronouns, attitudes or attire have been vilified or punished.  In the United States there was a 20th Century law insisting that women must wear at least 3 items of "women's clothing" at any given time, while today in Western Europe the presence of a masculine-of-centre person in the women's changing room or bathroom line is discomforting enough to some to lead to confrontations or blatant double takes.  The poet Andrea Gibson illustrates the absurd rage that gender non-conformity can inspire in her poem "Your Life" with the lines "your life every time airport security screams "pink or blue? "pink or blue" trying to figure out what machine setting to run you through".   

I identify as a butch lesbian and that is reflected in the way I dress.  I'm also a outdoorsperson who loves adventure gear and clothing.  So you can imagine my wardrobe looks a little like this:

Think plaid, hiking boots, walking shorts, approach shoes, plain tees and practical puffy jackets.  As a concession to urban environments I may occasionally wear a pair of jeans and Doc Martens.  While my style is recognisable in the queer community and leads to many a lesbian nod, in traditionally gendered places I can cause confusion, fear, discomfort.  Going to the toilet in public is an activity fraught with uncertainty and I often put considerable thought into this seemingly innocuous activity.  If I take my hat off will I present as more "female"?  Should I just wait until we go somewhere with a gender neutral bathroom?  Like Andrea Gibson, I have had many an awkward airport encounter where the security officials are unsure whether to ask a man or woman to frisk me. 

All this is to say that when I moved to Queenstown, New Zealand, I was instantly struck by how everyone dressed like me, and therefore how safe I felt.  All the mental energy that I usually unconsciously poured into avoiding being misgendered was freed up for other things.  As an outsider, here this is my best attempt to explain Queentown's sartorial identity and to hazard a guess as to why that is the case.  The town's culture appears to be defined by it's proximity to mountains and to Lake Wakatipu.  People live there because they want to ski, SUP, climb, mountain bike, hike or paraglide and they put up with seasonal swarms of tourists in order to do so.  Locals seem to oscillate between very outdoor activity specific outfits (riding straight to the bar after a mountain bike session) and a kind of ski-bum grunge look.  In Queenstown, snapbacks are no longer the preserve of baby dykes and hiking sandals are de rigueur.

In my experience, for sports where you need technical equipment or clothing, it is nigh on impossible to queer these bits of kit.  A climbing harness is just a climbing harness, a wetsuit just a wetsuit and, unless you put some sweet **"[what a time to be gay and alive](https://archiebongiovanni.bigcartel.com/)"** stickers on it, a bike helmet is just a bike helmet.  Even the heteronormative colour schemes that so often plague women's outdoor apparel are seemingly rejected in Queenstown.  Skaters of every gender wore purple, hikers were most concerned with having jackets that made them visible on the hillside than visibly categorise-able by gender, and all climbers know that you have to wear yellow trousers to really pop in the photos. 

As a place devoted to outdoor sports and activities, Queenstown makes conventional gendered clothing feel far from the "norm".  Consequently, for the first time in my life, I could wake up and put on any combination of my clothing and go about my day without having to worry about being misgendered or singled out.  And it felt good!  

Although I move through the world visibly queer, I also do so with an immense amount of privilege.  As a middle-class white person I have been presented with the narrative that the outdoors is a space to relax and recreate and the vast majority of adventure media reflects that narrative back at me.  It is not lost on me that although Queenstown represented a place for me to feel safe and to be myself, it is also a town built on settled land in a country colonised by British imperialism, and indigenous Maori folks are underrepresented in New Zealand's outdoor sports and communities.  ff you're white and reading this then check out the blog Melanin Basecamp.  They do a fantastic job of bringing white privilege in the outdoors into focus and I can't recommend them enough -  their blogger Nadia Mercado's article "[how to take up space in the outdoors](https://www.melaninbasecamp.com/trip-reports/2020/4/5/taking-up-space-in-the-outdoors)" is an important read for everyone.  

My queer hiking pals and I joke about the phenomenon of the practical lesbian jacket (PLJ) - a waterproof shell worn by a lesbian - but in Queenstown it seems that everyone is on board with the PLJ regardless of their gender and sexuality.  The local commitment to practicality and comfort overrode any preconceived notions about gendered clothing and that freedom was intoxicating to me.  Until people stop feeling entitled to police gender non-conforming people who are just trying to use the bathroom or get changed then I will continue to seek out communities that make me feel safe.  In the rest of my travels I will try and take a little bit of Queenstown with me so I can try and retain the confidence I felt there - and I will start by getting my first pair of Tevas.
