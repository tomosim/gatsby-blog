Practical Lesbian Jacket. abbr PLJ. Noun. A piece of upper body outerwear that is activity appropriate - usually associated with the outdoor pursuits. Very much function over fashion. While a jacket does not have to been worn by a person who identifies as a lesbian to be considered a PLJ, a certain amount of dyke swagger does increase the chances that a jacket may be assigned the moniker PLJ.

What you wear says a lot about you: what you expect your day to bring, your profession, your hobbies or favoured brands - and people make assumptions about you based on your clothing choices. As a queer person, clothing can be imbued with a further level of meaning. As Kam Dhillon put it in their essay [Queering Fashion History](https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/queering-fashion-history): "clothing has historically been more than a sartorial medium for the queer community, itâ€™s adopted the form of a secret language to speak and connect with each other in periods of societal oppression." Throughout history, homosexuality has been pathologised and legislated against, and this continues to this day in some parts of the world. Therefore the queer community has become adept at using appearance to signal many things: from being visible to one another, to signalling sexual proclivities (the hanky code being a prime example).

Unsurprisingly mainstream society can be quite attached to their binary gender roles and so those of us who blur the lines of female/male in our identity, pronouns, attitudes or attire have often been vilified or punished. In the United States there was a 20th Century law insisting that women must wear at least 3 items of "women's clothing" at any given time, while today in Western Europe the presence of a masculine-of-centre person in the women's changing room or bathroom line is discomforting enough to some to lead to confrontations or blatant double takes. I resonate hard with the poet Andrea Gibson's illustration of the absurd rage that gender non-conformity can inspire in the poem "Your Life". The line "your life every time airport security screams "pink or blue? "pink or blue" trying to figure out what machine setting to run you through" is a depressing reality for some. 

I identify as a butch lesbian and that is reflected in the way I dress. I'm also a outdoorsperson who loves adventure gear and clothing. A rummage through my wardrobe results in lewks like this:

Think plaid, hiking boots, walking shorts, approach shoes, plain tees and practical puffy jackets. As a concession to urban environments I may occasionally wear a pair of jeans and Doc Martens. While my style is recognisable in the queer community and leads to many a lesbian nod, in traditionally gendered places I can cause confusion, fear, discomfort. Going to the toilet in public is an activity fraught with uncertainty and I often put considerable thought into this seemingly innocuous activity. If I take my hat off will I present as more "female"? Should I just wait until we go somewhere with a gender neutral bathroom? Like Andrea Gibson, I have had many an awkward airport encounter where the security officials are unsure whether to ask a man or woman to frisk me.

All this is to say that when I moved to Queenstown, New Zealand, I was instantly struck by how everyone dressed like me, and therefore how safe I felt. All the mental energy that I usually unconsciously poured into avoiding being misgendered was freed up for other things. As an outsider, here this is my best attempt to explain Queentown's sartorial identity and to hazard a guess as to why that is the case:

The town's culture appears to be defined by it's proximity to mountains and to Lake Wakatipu. People live there because they want to ski, SUP, climb, mountain bike, hike or paraglide and they put up with the seasonal swarms of tourists (and sandflies!) in order to do so. Locals seem to oscillate between very outdoor activity specific outfits (riding straight to the bar after a mountain bike session) and a kind of ski-bum grunge look. In Queenstown, snapbacks are no longer the preserve of baby dykes and hiking sandals are de rigueur. Sitting in a local beer garden, there are practical lesbian jackets as far as the eye can see.

Even the heteronormative colour schemes that so often plague women's outdoor apparel are seemingly rejected in Queenstown. Skaters of every gender wore purple, hikers were most concerned with having jackets that made them visible on the hillside than visibly categorise-able by gender, and all climbers know that you have to wear yellow trousers to really pop in the photos.

As a place devoted to outdoor sports and activities, Queenstown makes conventional gendered clothing feel far from the "norm". Perhaps this is because of the nature of outdoors equipment. In my experience, for sports where you need technical equipment or clothing, it is nigh on impossible to queer these bits of kit, conversely it is hard to do the opposite too. A climbing harness is just a climbing harness, a wetsuit just a wetsuit and, unless you put some sweet **"[what a time to be gay and alive](https://archiebongiovanni.bigcartel.com/)"** stickers on it, a bike helmet is just a bike helmet. Consequently, for the first time in my life, I could wake up and put on any combination of my clothing and go about my day without having to worry about being misgendered or singled out. And it felt good!

I would like to note that although I felt safe and unremarkable as a visibly queer person in Queenstown- that is largely to do with the privilege I hold. The very outdoors clothing and equipment that makes me fit in can be prohibitively expensive, and the culture I felt so at home in is one that perpetuates the narrative of the outdoors as a place for mainly white people to recreate in. It is not lost on me that Queenstown is a town built on settled land in a country colonised by British imperialism, and I'm a British person feeling at home there. I say this not to undermine anyone's experience but to recognise that not all queer experiences are created equal and that outdoors culture can be more exclusive than we'd like. The blog Melanin Basecamp does a fantastic job of unpacking white privilege in the outdoors and I can't recommend them enough - their blogger Nadia Mercado's article "[how to take up space in the outdoors](https://www.melaninbasecamp.com/trip-reports/2020/4/5/taking-up-space-in-the-outdoors)" is an important read for everyone.

My queer hiking pals and I often wax lyrical about the merits of the PLJ but in Queenstown it seems that everyone is on board with the PLJ regardless of their gender and sexuality. The local commitment to practicality and comfort overrode any preconceived notions about gendered clothing and that freedom was intoxicating to me. Until people stop clinging so desperately to their gender binaries then I will continue to seek out communities that make me feel safe and in the rest of my travels I will try and take a little bit of Queenstown with me. PLJs and plaid forever!
