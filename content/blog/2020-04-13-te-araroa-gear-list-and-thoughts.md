No one hikes their first thru-hike perfectly. That is to say, no one reflects on their first trip and decides they wouldn't change a thing. I think this is one of the factors that makes long distance hiking so compelling, once you've got the bug you can't wait to do it again, but do it better. During my hike of the Te Araroa I learned lots that I will take with me to other trails. For instance: how to construct a mouse-proof food hang that would survive even the most rodent infested of huts and not to wear Goretex footwear if it's going to be a wet trail (they take so much longer to dry than their non-waterproof counterparts).

The aspect of thru-hiking that gets walkers excited more than anything else however is undoubtedly gear. Gear they carry, ditch, covet and buy en route. I am no exception to this rule and so below have listed all the gear I used on the trail and give some thoughts on how I'd like my kit to evolve for future hikes. If you prefer pie charts and are remotely interested then you can see the same information at my [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/1v2xh4).

### Base Weight

Base weight means the weight of your pack without any worn items or consumables i.e. food, water or fuel. As an aficionado of YouTube thru-hiking videos and blogs I was acutely aware of the importance of base weight. On the internet, a low base weight seems to give you credibility as ultralight hiker - although there was surprisingly little of that attitude actually on the trail. Maybe this is because I was in new-zealand where the "tramping" culture is much more rugged and therefore kit traditionally errs on the side of durable rather than lightweight.

At 7.84 kg (17lbs 4oz) my base weight was reasonably high for a thru-hiker. As I hiked the trail on a bit of a whim I didn't plan my gear as well as I might have otherwise, and I didn't have an opportunity to weigh my pack until I got back to the UK. I was pretty shocked when I added up all my gear and found how heavy it was in total. All that carrying heavy packs in the Army paid off I guess as it never felt like a particularly onerous weight while I was hiking. Having said that, I'm sure I would have skipped up inclines with much more ease if I lightened the load somewhat so I started to consider which bits of kit I could lose completely or swap out for a lighter alternative.

### So, What Would I Change?

##### Redundancy

One thing I noticed with my gear compared to other hikers was that if I thought an item really important I tended to carry more than one of them. For instance I carried 2 lighters and some matches "just in case" (at one point I was up to 3 lighters due to hoarding). Although I do think that it's a good idea to have more than one means of making flames, I probably would have been fine with 1 lighter a couple of matches. Sure a lighter doesn't weigh much on it's own but this attitude of having more than one of things adds up eventually. You can see my tendency to carry extras in my clothes and electronics - I definitely could have got away with less. If I were to give some advice to future thru-hikers to help them avoid carrying extras I would suggest they go for a 2 or 3 night hiking trip and actually test how long their phone lasts so they have a good idea of what kind of battery pack they will need. A test run hike is a good idea in general - I met hikers on the trail who didn't know how to put their tents up as they hadn't ever done it before...

##### Clothes

Looking at my gear list it quickly becomes clear that I took a **lot** of clothes with me. I am a person who is haunted by expectations of the worst case scenario and therefore I often try and mitigate the risk of things going wrong. One of the ways this manifests in the outdoors is that I always take an extra layer of warm kit with me. Wilderness First Aid and Pre-Hospital Emergency Care courses have impressed upon me that if someone falls and breaks a leg in the outdoors they - and their companions - risk becoming hypothermic while they wait for mountain rescue. This is why I always take an extra warm layer out into the hills with me and explains why I carried both a softshell _and_ a down jacket. In reality, I wore the down jacket exactly twice, and although I appreciated it both times, I could definitely have lived without it. Perhaps in future I will take a leaf out of my friend Happy Feet's book and eschew all warm layers less a lightweight sleep hoody and waterproof jacket. His philosophy is that if he needs emergency warmth then he can crack out his shelter and quilt - and I can't argue with that. In an emergency, one of the benefits of thru-hiking rather than day hiking is that you are carrying shelter, warmth and brew kit with you as standard. I will try and bear this in mind next time I pack, although I'm not sure I can ditch all my warm layers in one fell swoop so might just leave the down jacket at home next time.

##### Pack

Looking at my gear list, by far my heaviest single item was my pack. The ULA Circuit straddles the divide between conventional, heavier packs and ultralight packs designed with weight rather than durability in mind. I really liked it's streamlined design and definitely felt like I could drag it through scratchy beech forest with no ill effect but there is no beating around the bush: replacing it would reduce my baseweight considerably. I am currently saving up for an [Atom Pack](https://atompacks.co.uk/) bag which start at 580g and would made a huge difference to by baseweight.

### Gear I Wish I Packed

##### Foam Pad

Don't get me wrong I loved my Therm-a-Rest inflatable pad, it always helped nights in my tent feel luxurious and has excellent insulating properties. There were times however when I wished I had the foresight to bring a small foam pad like the [Gossamer Gear Thinlight Foam Pad](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/thinlight-foam-pad) with me as well. Full disclosure, I didn't come to this realisation independently, my friend Happy Feet had one and I was jealous of all the ways it proved useful for him! For instance, on the South Island portion of the Te Araroa most nights are spent sleeping in backcountry huts. These vary from fancy multi-room dwellings with flushing toilets and a warden to one room tin huts with leaky ceilings and rat infestations. One thing they all have in common is that if you are lucky enough to get a bed then you lie on a plastic mattress (anyone who has every slept in a military transit camp will recognise them immediately). I got very intimate with these mattresses as sleeping in a quilt meant there was nothing between me and the mattress. This wasn't usually a huge issue, but on hot nights I had to endure sticking to the plastic surface and in some of the more rodent-filled huts I didn't appreciate knowing that I was sleeping on a surface that had been host for some rat scampering. Happy Feet just unrolled this foam pad and slept on top of that and I liked his style. It also would have eased my fears about my Therm-a-Rest getting a puncture if I had been able to roll this out first when camping on particularly uneven or spiky ground. It can also double as a sit pad at breaks and at only 70g and \$18 it won't break your back or the bank.

##### Trowel

I thought I was being smart by not packing a trowel, telling myself I'd just dig a cat hole with my trekking pole. That's all well and good until you're desperate and frantically hacking at the stony ground with a trekking pole just isn't working as quickly as you'd like. I learned my lesson and will be taking a lightweight trowel on my next trip.

##### Compass

Hiking on the Te Araroa was out of my navigational comfort zone because so much of the trail relied on following orange markers and digital mapping. I usually like to carry paper maps as a back up to digital mapping but on long trails that quickly becomes quite impractical. I did meet people who were carrying paper maps so clearly it if possible \*but\* the NZ Topo maps are at a scale of 1:50000 and therefore don't give as much detail as the 1:25000 Ordnance Survey maps we are blessed with in the UK and so I decided they weren't worth packing. One concession I wish I had made to my usual navigational neuroses was to bring a compass. Although I only got lost on the trail twice, and then not seriously, it did occur to me how easy it would be to get turned around in a forest and lose the trail completely. In this instance a compass would be useful so you could walk on a bearing and not end up walking in circles a la Blair Witch.

### So What?

As already stated, no one hikes their first thru-hike perfectly and actually I suspect no one ever hikes a thru-hike perfectly. There will always be better, lighter gear being made, different trails will require different kit and hikers will keep on innovating - inevitably there will always be lessons learned about gear and items swapped in and out of your pack.

I think my main takeaway from hiking the Te Araroa in terms of gear is that my pack weighed a lot more than I thought. And my second takeaway is that is clearly didn't matter that much! Yes there were days when I wished it was lighter (climbing Mt Rintoul with 3.5 litres of water and 7 days worth of food comes to mind) but overall I carried it with ease. A lighter baseweight is sometimes held up as some kind of holy grail in thru-hiking and of course you can hike further and faster with a lighter pack but as I discovered, it is possible to hike long distance with a baseweight of nearly 8kg or 17.6lbs. That said, tweaking gear lists is half the fun of being a hiker so there will be changes afoot!
