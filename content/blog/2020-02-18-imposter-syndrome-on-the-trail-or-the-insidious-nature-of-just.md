Over 800km into the Te Araroa trail, and having met countless other hikers on the journey, I have identified a predictable transaction that takes place whenever walkers cross paths.  It goes a little like this:

"Are you hiking the TA?"

"Yes"

"NOBO\* or SOBO\**?"

"NOBO"

"Nice.  Going all the way to Cape Reinga?"

"Nah, **just** the South Island."

For those wondering, Cape Reinga is the Northernmost terminus of the Te Araroa, right at the top of the North Island of New Zealand.  As someone who is only hiking the length of the South Island, I will be finishing in Ship's Cove, some 1500 km short of the complete route.

I come away from all these conversations feeling like my bubble has well and truly been burst.  Suddenly walking 1306 km seems lame, like the easy way out.  *Real* hikers go the whole 3007 km or bust.  Not only do I feel inadequate after these chats, I also feel complicit in bringing myself down - and it's all thanks to that work "just". 

"Just" is a slippery word. Merriam-Webster has 14 different definitions for the word - it's meaning changes depending on emphasis, syntax or context.  When I use it on the trail I imagine that it is a synonym for "only"or "simply", diminishing my adventure with one small adverb.

My friend Liz has a list of words that she thinks should be banished from our lexicons.  Actually, "should" is one of them (sorry Liz), as is "sorry". Oops!  No matter how many times I try to convince her that it's polite to apologise to someone who bumped into you in the street, she is adamant that those casual apologies imply that our time is less valuable and they stop us from taking up the space we deserve.  She advocates swapping "I'm sorry" with "thank you" so try "thanks for your patience" rather than "sorry to keep you waiting".  I suspect that, used in a self-depreciating context, "just" may very well be another of these unhelpful words.

Occasionally I meet hikers of the Te Araroa who give me a much-needed reality check.  Day hikers outright laugh at me when I admit I'm only walking the South Island, and remind me that it's still a pretty damn long way from Bluff to Ship's Cove.  Or SOBOs will earnestly inform me that I have made a good choice in avoiding the many kms of road walking that exist on the North Island.  Equally often I meet hikers who not only want to compare distances walked but also the purity of your route, how much your pack weighs, how many previous thru hikes you have done.  Some people just can't resist a pissing contest!  One girl told me that another hiker accused her of hiking all wrong (??) - this surprised her as she'd already travelled over 650 km without issue.   I also met an incredible woman who completed the entire Te Araroa route in **just** 66 days!  Not only was she pretty inspirational but meeting her was a useful reminder that there will always be people who are faster, fitter, better equipped and more hardcore than you.  That being the case, maybe I can beat the hiking imposter syndrome that creeps in after the traditional Te Araroa exchange by changing my perception of the language used. 

Back to those definitions of "just".  What if I interpret the word differently?  I subconsciously used it positively in the paragraph above, so I know it's possible.  I could potentially use it in lieu of "precisely/exactly", as in "this cup of tea is just what the doctor ordered" or "quite/very" as in "this view is just wonderful".   Next time I tell someone I'm "just" doing the South Island of the Te Araroa I will be using the word as an indication of preciseness.  In 2020, I will be walking 1306 km of the Te Araroa, no more, no less.  Besides, I'll come back for the next 1701 km another year. 

\*NOBO - A north-bounder.  Someone walking from the bottom of the South Island (Bluff) northwards. 

\*\*SOBO - A south-bounder.  Someone walking the opposite direction!
