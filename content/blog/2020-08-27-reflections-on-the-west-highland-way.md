I spent the past 8 days on the West Highland Way (WHW) and wanted to capture my thoughts on the walk before I return to the daily grind, and long days spent hiking happily are just a fuzzy memory.  The 96 mile (or 154 kilometre) walk is one of the UK's most iconic long distance hiking routes.  It starts just North of Glasgow, finishes in Fort William, and makes its way through some of West Scotland's most famously beautiful scenery.  Usually, the WHW is very busy, especially in the summer time, but my hiking companion and I soon discovered that this year was very different.  As expected, the footfall on the trail was much lower than usual - with one person telling us that usually they have 500 WHW walkers coming through their bar every day as opposed to this years average of 50 a day.  This probably means that my experiences will be a little different to most who have completed this hike in more "normal" years.

To set the scene: this was the first multi-day hike I had done since I completed half of the Te Araroa (TA) in March 2020.  I made the mistake of applying a lot of my TA expectations to the WHW, and also assumed that my fitness levels would be comparable.  Obviously, no amount of lockdown yoga enthusiasm was going to condition me for long distance hiking so this assumption proved to be sadly false.  

The following is not a thorough trip report, rather, some hints and tips that occurred to me as I hiked.  There are plenty of excellent resources for the WHW - such as [Walk Highlands](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/west-highland-way.shtml) and the official [WHW website](https://www.westhighlandway.org/) - if you would like more in-detailed planning information.

1. **Don't Pack Too Much Food!**

I am a cautious person by nature, so usually carrying a bit of extra food doesn't bother me.  I see it as insurance against unforeseen circumstances or good admin in case I am extra hungry.  However, it is not an exaggeration to say that my food bag hardly decreased in size (or weight) at all on the WHW.  There are just too many cafes/restaurants/shops along the way! It would take stronger willpower than mine to be able to choose recurring porridge in the tent over a hot breakfast roll in the nearby cafe.  Of course you will need to take some personal snacks and supplies but if you're feeling flush you could probably buy the majority of your meals on the trail.  Alternatively, if you are on a budget or just determined to test out some backpacking meal recipes then be prepared to have your resolve tested as you pass by cafes, hotels and the like.  

2. **Goretex Footwear Is Best**

On the TA it is received wisdom that non-goretex boots/shoes are better. They dry more quickly and, given the number of river crossings you do, fast-drying footwear is desirable.  To that end I approached this hike with a "goretex shoes are rubbish" philosophy.  Luckily for me, my non-goretex Altras had given up on me somewhere near Hanmer Springs  so I had to resort to packing my waterproofs trail runners instead.  And truly, I am pleased I did.  At points the trail was muddy and littered with puddles that I could happily splash through rather than worrying about getting wet socks.  There weren't any *real* river crossings to no sodden shoes to worry about either.  I would 100% wear waterproof footwear again as the trail rewarded me with dry feet throughout and I know I would have been a lot more miserable if I was wild camping and had to contend with wet shoes.

3. **Smelling Is A Choice**

As with the cafes and shops - hotels, hostels and proper campsites litter the WHW.  That doesn't mean you can't wild camp throughout (although you'd have avoid a long stretch of the no camping zone in the Loch Lomand and the Trossachs Park) but it does mean that there will be hikers on the trail who are showering every day.  This is not a place where the hiker trash lifestyle rules.  I showered 3/8 days on the trail and I still felt self-conscious about how bad my one set of clothes smelled by the end.  You will meet hikers who have hired baggage transfer services to deliver their suitcases each night - easily identifiable by their clean change of clothes for dinner - and people who have adopted a more ultralight approach.  Just be aware that what is normal for you might be extraordinary for others and if you choose to wear the same thing everyday in the spirit of packing light then you may be asked some incredulous questions about it. 

4. **The WHW Is Harder Than I Thought**

This one is hard to admit but I definitely assumed the WHW would be a walk in the park.  I had visions of an even-surfaced thoroughfare cutting through the countryside and equally fantastic visions of me speeding along on these nice easy-going trails.  Sadly this was not the case at all.  Despite it's popularity the trail is pretty rugged in parts and can lead to a depressingly slow walking pace.  My thru-hiking ego was demolished on days 2 and 3 when the path along the shore of Loch Lomand descended into endless, uneven, ups and downs that had my legs aching and my lungs burning.  Progress was a lot tougher than expected and I was definitely feeling frustrated.  It was a useful lesson in not getting cocky as clearly not all trails and created equal and just because I walked a long way once doesn't mean I can necessarily do it again straight off the bat!  I'm pleased to report however, that by the last couple of days the both my condition and the trail's condition improved and I felt like I was cruising again.

5. **Wild Camping Has Pros and Cons**

One of the best things about adventuring in Scotland is that it's legal to wild camp almost everywhere - this means you can get out in the hills without having to spend lots of money on accommodation and also makes it easier to having socially distanced trips in the time of COVID-19.  Wild camping is possible on the WHW (although to avoid the no camping area around Loch Lomand you would need to walk a longgg way) and is a great option for the trail.  Some businesses encourage you to wild camp nearby so you can use their facilities - for instance the Kingshouse in Glen Coe lets you camp out the back.  This has the benefit of giving you access to their nice toilets and coin operated showers but also means you can get hot food and drinks from the bar as required. By taking a tent we found we had a lot more freedom in planning our days in terms of the distances walked.  It also meant that although we were on a fairly busy trail we had some nights in the tent where we didn't see another soul - an unexpected wilderness experience!  However camping isn't all plain sailing as Scotland's notorious midges are out in force in the summertime and they are voracious.  If I were to hike the trail again I would definitely take a tent for the flexibility but I would also arrange a few nights in campsites or hostels along the way so I got the best of both worlds.

6. **Butties and Brews and Beers, Oh My!**

As the title suggests, there are plenty of things to spend your money on on the WHW.  Just something to bear in mind when budgeting for the trip.  If, like me, you have the breaking strain of a wet Kitkat then you will end up buying a lot of hot breakfasts and cups of tea.

7. **Midges**

I'm not sure I can fully explain just how awful midges can be using words alone, but maybe this anecdote will help:  On our last morning we woke up in our tent having camped in a beautiful spot the night before.  Unfortunately the wind had died down so there was nothing keeping the hordes of midges away and even from the inside of our tent we could see that they were waiting outside for us in their thousands.  There was nothing for it but to pack up as quickly as possible but as soon as we dived outside they were on us, biting through clothes and all.  Taking down the tent meant that all the insects that were sitting on it rose up in a horrifying cloud and enveloped us.  I have never packed away more quickly, or more painfully.  Each time I bent to put something in my pack I had to put my face into this cloud of midges and you better believe they bit the hell out of my face, ears, neck and anywhere else they could.  When we were finally ready to leave we *ran* away from the campsite feeling fully traumatised.  So, for the love of god take midge repellent and a head net.  And don't make the same mistake as me and bring a head net with holes big enough to let the midges in! RIP my face.
