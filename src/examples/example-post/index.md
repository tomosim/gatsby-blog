# This is an example Heading

## Welcome to my sub heading

This file is known as a markdown file. They're a nice simple way of doing some pretty decent document formatting. It is:

1. Easier than HTML
2. Less crappy than microsoft word.

[A cheat sheet can be found here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

<figure>
  <img src="beach.jpg" alt="me and my bike"> 
  <figcaption>The above picture points to the .jpg file in the same directory. You can use as many pictures as you like. The 'figcaption' is not necessary, although the 'alt' is.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a paragraph. No fancy formatting going on here. You can make parts of the paragraph **bold** or _italic_ if you want. URLS are done like [this](https://www.google.com).

At the top of this file you'll see a section that looks like this:

```md

This is meta data for this file that will not be rendered but is necessary for the website to build correctly. Be sure to fill it in correctly with each post.
